## Customizing and Localizing AnyConnect

To customize and localize AnyConnect, you can modify installation settings, adjust client behavior, and configure localization parameters.

### Modifying Installation Behavior

- Use `ACTransforms.xml` for modifying installation behavior on Windows and macOS.
- Disable the Customer Experience Feedback module if necessary.

```xml
<ACTransforms>
    <DisableVPN>true</DisableVPN>
</ACTransforms>
```

### Localization Settings

- Localize the AnyConnect GUI, messages, and installer screens.
- Create and upload a custom AnyConnect Help file.
- Add or edit AnyConnect text and messages using translation tables.

## AnyConnect Profile Editor

The AnyConnect Profile Editor allows administrators to configure VPN profiles, connection settings, and security policies. Some of the main settings include:

- **Preferences**: General connection settings, automatic reconnection options.
- **Backup Servers**: Configuring failover servers for VPN connectivity.
- **Certificate Matching**: Defining authentication certificates.
- **Mobile Policy**: Settings for mobile device support.
- **Server List**: Managing VPN servers for connection.

## Configuring VPN Access

AnyConnect provides various VPN connectivity options. The key settings include:

- **Start Before Logon (SBL)**: Automatically establishes VPN before Windows logon.
- **Always-On VPN**: Ensures continuous VPN connectivity.
- **Trusted Network Detection (TND)**: Automatically connects or disconnects based on network status.
- **Captive Portal Detection**: Identifies and mitigates captive portal login restrictions.

```bash
# Example: Configuring Trusted Network Detection
vpn config trusted_network_detection enable
```

## Managing VPN Authentication

Authentication methods supported by AnyConnect include:

- **Certificate-based authentication**: Uses digital certificates for secure logins.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Combines username/password with additional security measures.
- **SAML Authentication**: Allows users to authenticate through identity providers.

### Configuring Certificate Authentication

To enable certificate authentication:

1. Generate and import a digital certificate.
2. Configure certificate matching rules in the profile.
3. Set the VPN connection profile to use certificate authentication.

## Network Access Manager

The Network Access Manager (NAM) in AnyConnect provides network authentication and connection policy enforcement.

- Supports **EAP, PEAP, TTLS, and TLS** authentication.
- Enforces security policies on wired and wireless networks.
- Enables **Single Sign-On (SSO)** functionality.

> [!info]
> **Best Practice:** Ensure that NAM profiles are configured to allow fallback authentication in case of a primary failure.

## Configuring Posture Compliance

Posture compliance ensures that client devices meet security policies before being granted network access. It includes:

- **HostScan**: Scans endpoints for compliance.
- **ISE Posture Module**: Integrates with Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) to enforce policies.
- **Advanced Endpoint Assessment**: Detects antivirus and firewall status.

```json
{
    "compliance": {
        "antivirus": "enabled",
        "firewall": "active"
    }
}
```

## Using Network Visibility Module (NVM)

NVM enables visibility into user network activity to enhance security analytics.

- Collects data on application usage, traffic patterns, and device behavior.
- Supports flow filters for traffic classification.
- Provides integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems.

> **Note:** NVM requires kernel driver modules to be installed and configured correctly.

## Troubleshooting AnyConnect

If AnyConnect encounters issues, follow these troubleshooting steps:

- **Check logs**: Review logs in `C:\ProgramData\Cisco\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\Logs`.
- **Run DART**: Use the Diagnostic and Reporting Tool (DART) to collect system logs.
- **Verify Connectivity**: Ensure that the VPN server is reachable.
- **Reinstall AnyConnect**: If persistent issues arise, uninstall and reinstall the client.

## AnyConnect on Mobile Devices

AnyConnect supports mobile platforms, including iOS and Android. Key features:

- **Per-App VPN**: Allows VPN connections for specific applications.
- **Always-On VPN**: Ensures continuous VPN availability.
- **Split Tunneling**: Directs specific traffic through VPN while allowing other traffic to use the local network.

### Configuring Mobile VPN on iOS

1. Install AnyConnect from the App Store.
2. Configure VPN profiles and authentication settings.
3. Enable **Per-App VPN** in the deviceâ€™s VPN settings.

```yaml
vpn:
  enable: true
  mode: per-app
```
